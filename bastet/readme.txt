Create a twist on the classic game 'Tetris'. The twist would be that the game would always choose the worst-fitting block possible to make it as annoying to play as possible. A few examples of the concept are linked below.

Use the LÃ–VE framework to do this, which you can find at www.love2d.org. Counting scores, difficulty levels or intro screens are not required, but of course would be nice to have if you have time. Graphics are also completely unimportant, it's totally ok to use just colored rectangles.

What we are testing/looking for in this are (in order of importance):

- Your ability to learn new things quickly
- Readability/quality of your code
- How you approach the given problem of picking the worst block
- Good coding practices (commenting, techniques to reduce the number of possible problems)
- Attention to detail

Bonus points for:

- Visual effects / details (fades, animations, other effects?)
- Intro screen
- increasing difficulty (either by speed or by tuning the algorithm)
- Highscore table
- any other (bug-free, well programmed) features you come up with
